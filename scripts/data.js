The design process involved multiple phases of ideation, prototyping, and user testing to refine the physical sensor\u2019s ergonomics and the digital interface\u2019s usability.",
                    "",
                    "The sensor attachment is designed to be unobtrusive and compatible with a wide range of kettles, making setup quick and easy. The digital interface, accessible via any web-enabled device, features a clean, intuitive layout that emphasizes ease of navigation and visual learning. Users can view animated replays of their pours, overlaying different sessions to visually identify differences and improvements. This feature is particularly useful for visual learners who can mimic the motions for practice.",

                    "Moreover, BrewTrack pushes the envelope by saving motion data as JSON/SVG files. This not only allows for easy sharing and community engagement but also supports the creation of a \"recipe\" database. Here, users can explore how variations in pouring affect the taste and quality of the coffee, fostering a deeper connection and understanding within the brewing community. The technology behind BrewTrack is pioneering, as no other tool currently offers such a detailed and user-oriented approach to coffee brewing analytics.",

                    "In conclusion, BrewTrack is more than just a brewing aid; it's a comprehensive platform that educates, engages, and empowers coffee lovers. By tackling the often-overlooked aspects of pour-over brewing with a smart, user-focused design, BrewTrack is set to revolutionize the way we understand and enjoy our daily coffee. Whether you are a novice hoping to learn the ropes or an expert aiming to perfect your pour, BrewTrack offers the tools and insights necessary to elevate your brewing journey."

I found that while efforts to onboard people into the screening process were strong, the post-screening and management phase was often overlooked, resulting in stagnating or worsening health outcomes and ineffective screenings. This was especially the case for taxi and private hire drivers, who had irregular schedules and largely sedentary lifestyles that made engaging in health interventions difficult. "

While embedding health solutions in the driver\u2019s app was ineffective as it was seen primarily as a tool for jobs and earnings, social features like peer-organised gatherings and social validation successfully engaged drivers in health-related activities.

It is available in multiple languages and is written in simple terms to ensure clear communication with vendors. Each section addresses the three main concerns, supported with data and case study. These include demonstrating the demand for lower sodium dishes, evidence that there will be no increase in costs, and examples showing that reducing sodium does not significantly alter taste. In fact, customers may even be more satisfied with meals after learning about the reduced sodium content.",

The data has been reframed to highlight the benefits to vendors, supporting the promoter as they continue to persuade vendors to reduce sodium. These two stages will repeat until the vendors are unwilling to reduce sodium any further. \n"
